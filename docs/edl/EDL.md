# Entity Definition Language

This is the language used to define your entities, domains, languages, interfaces, units and finally how to configure an application/project so that the Entity Compiler can generate source code. The language can be broken down into the following major components:

| Component | Description |
| ---------	| -----------	|
| [Entity](EDL_Entity.md) | Describes the data model of your application. |
| [Domain](EDL_Domain.md)| Describes how that same model is represented in different places across your enterprise (server code, client code, documentation, etc.).|
| [Interface](EDL_Interface.md)|Describe how that data is communicated across the enterprise.|
| [Space](EDL_Space.md) | Defines a space to contain entities for your application. |
| [Configuration](EDL_Configuration.md)|Describes how to build an application from the above.|

Each of these have their own document, just click the links above.
