# Entity Model Classes

As the Entity Compiler parses your model (written in the Entity Definition Language), it creates a tree of Entity Model Class objects. The most obvious class would be the one that describes an entity which is called `MTEntity`.  The top nodes of this tree is given to each template that is run, allowing it to extract any information about your entity model that it needs to generate the code it is designed to generate.

These entity model classes are grouped into the following types:


| Model Class Type | Description |
|---|---|
| [Configuration](EMC_config.md) | This represents a grouping of classes that deal with how an application or synthesis of an application is configured. |
| [Entity](EMC_entity.md) | Model classes of this type are directly related to the entities in your model. |
| [Domain](EMC_domain.md) | Model classes that are domain specific are of this type. |
| [Expression](EMC_expression.md) | Model classes used to describe expressions are of this type. |
| [Foundation](EMC_foundation.md) | The model classes of this type are intended to provide support for foundation type functions. Currently only array/set classes are supported. |
| [Tagging](EMC_tagging.md) | Model classes used to describe tags are of this type. |
| [Template](EMC_template.md) | Classes used by the template engine to structure and execute the code. |
